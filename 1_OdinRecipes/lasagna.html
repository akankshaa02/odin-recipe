    <p>
      lasagna is a traditional Italian dish that is made by layering wide, flat
      pasta noodles with a variety of other ingredients, such as tomato sauce,
      cheese, and meat. The dish is typically baked in the oven, which allows
      the layers to meld together and become deliciously rich and flavorful.
