    <p>
      Carrot cake is a type of cake that includes grated carrots in the batter,
      which gives it a moist and slightly dense texture. It often contains other
      ingredients like nuts, raisins, and spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and
      ginger. The cake is usually topped with a sweet and tangy cream cheese
      frosting, which complements the earthy flavors of the carrots.
